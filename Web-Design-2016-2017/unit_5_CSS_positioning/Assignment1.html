  <h1>CSS positioing</h1>
    <!-- positioning is how we change where objects are on the screen
    we can alter their position left, right, top, and bottomg
    there is also a Z-index which allows us to work with depth
    None of those tage can be made before you declare which positioning system you are using-->
    
    <!-- there are 4 positioning values
    static - this makes an element fall where it would by default there is no z-index here
    fixed - positions an element relative to the view port ie it will scroll with the page
    relative - this makes an element relative to itself and allows movement and introduces z-index
    absolute - this makes elements appear exactly where you want every time
    
    both relative and absolute defualt their values back to the parent object and if there is no parent
    object it defaults back to html.  a parent object for absolute is the last absolute or relative, a parent object for
    relative is the last absolute.
